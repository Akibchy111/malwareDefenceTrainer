            <h2>  1) A Virus At Its Simplist</h2>
            <p>Viruses are computer programs that are typically written in the C++ language, however that isnt always the case. For more simple, annoying code, they are written in batch for microsoft computers or bash script for apple. </p>
            <p>This following batch script will simply print out repeating numbers, akin to the matrix.</p>

        <article class = "protect">
            <h2> 2) Altering The Computer </h2>
            <p> The danger of these programs is how they affect your computer; what usually happens is that an ignorant user will believe that a file is what it seems to be and then give it administrative control, then the virus will manipulate files or aspects of the computer.</p>
            <p>This following script will change your computer's clock to midnight.</p>

        <article class = "protect">
            <h2> 3) Recognizing Unusual Activity </h2>
            <p> One common function of many viruses is that sometimes they will go to a new windows, change the default browser or enter urls despite you not inputing anything. This is a tell-tale sign and usually the first indicator that you have been infected. </p>
            <p>This following script will mimic how this might look for you. </p>

        <article class = "protect">
            <h2> 4) Altering Files  </h2>
            <p> A scary aspect of viruses is their capability to alter, create or delete files in your computer. This may be disasterous and costly to your computer's functions, especially if it deletes, lets say a system32 file.</p>
            <p>The first script will add a text file onto your computer, in the same location as you run the script.</p>
            <p>The second script will delete the text file added by the first script.</p>

        </article>
        <article class = "protect">
            <h2> 5) Disaster  </h2>
            <p> As mentioned above, a virus has the capability to destroy your computer. Modern windows computers have many ways to prevent something like this happening, so this is an extreemly rare occurrence, but nothing is impossible. Here at Malware Defence Trainer, we are above permanently damaging or altering your computer in any way, but not crashing them. Dont worry, as long as you save any work before, this script shoudnt have any lasting affect on your computer. </p>
            <p>This script will crash your computer, nothing more. </p>
