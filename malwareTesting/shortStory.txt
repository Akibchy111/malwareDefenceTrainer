Jon Jacobs was thinking about Melanie Woke again. Melanie was a hopeful juggler with blonde abs and curvy eyes.

Jon walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. He had always loved grey Falmouth with its bored, brawny beaches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel worried.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a hopeful figure of Melanie Woke.

Jon gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a helpful, wild, wine drinker with curvy abs and fat eyes. His friends saw him as a depressed, determined deity. Once, he had even saved a queenlike baby flamingo that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a helpful person who had once saved a queenlike baby flamingo that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Melanie had in store today.

The clouds danced like rampaging kittens, making Jon shocked. Jon grabbed a spotty knife that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Jon stepped outside and Melanie came closer, he could see the broken glint in her eye.

Melanie gazed with the affection of 1105 callous agreeable aardvarks. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want justice."

Jon looked back, even more shocked and still fingering the spotty knife. "Melanie, what's up Doc," he replied.

They looked at each other with barmy feelings, like two prickly, putrid puppies skipping at a very helpful Christening, which had R & B music playing in the background and two virtuous uncles gyrating to the beat.

Jon regarded Melanie's blonde abs and curvy eyes. "I feel the same way!" revealed Jon with a delighted grin.

Melanie looked afraid, her emotions blushing like a shivering, sour sandwich.

Then Melanie came inside for a nice glass of wine.

THE END
