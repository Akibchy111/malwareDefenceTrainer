The purpose of Malware Defence Trainer is to prepare and teach the general public how to defend against malware and cyberattacks. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Our philosophy: The best method for learning any material is to experience it yourself with hands-on learning, however when it comes to learning how to deal with malware, 
hands-on learning becomes risky. If one is not careful enough, they may cause irreparable damage to their files. So we created a website to rectify this problem. This site will help teach people what malware is, how to recognize it and what to do once it has infected your computer. This website will also give the user software that simulates what malware is capable of while still not damaging their computer. We will also have a ransomware training program that the user can download and decide what file they want to encode, such as  a useless text file. 
If the user is unable to decode, they can activate a killswitch that will uninstall the program and decode anything that was affected.
