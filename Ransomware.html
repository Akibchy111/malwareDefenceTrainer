       <h2> What is Ransomware?</h2>
       <p> Ransomware is a form of malware which attacks the victim's personal information or blocks access to parts of their computer until a ransom is paid off.
           Such attacks normally occur when someone encrypts files and looks for ransom in exchange to decrypt them. </p>

        <li>AIDS Trojan aka PC Cyborg is the first registered ransomware attack in history, and it happened in 1989. Harvard Biologist Joesph Popp is the one that created it. It was used by giving out infected floppy disks. They were sent to the people of the World Health Organization’s international AIDS conference. It hid file directories and blocked file names, and it asked the victim to send 189 USD to Panama. However, since it had weak encryption there weren’t any huge issues. </li>
